# Mortgage Data

This is a simple app built with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) that allows you to calculate the following based on the mortgage amount, the interest rate and the mortgage term.

1. Your monthly repayment.
2. The total cost of the loan
3. The total interest you'll pay
4. How much of each monthly payment goes to the loan vs interest
5. How paying extra each month can reduce your mortgage term + the interest you'll pay.

The app is deployed [here](https://mortgage.smithy.dev/)
